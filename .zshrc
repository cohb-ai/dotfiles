# this. Captures only the contiguous `#` lines immediately preceding `name() {`; a
# *blank* line resets the block (a bare `#` is kept as a spacer), so design
# rationale can sit above the help separated by one empty line. The renderer styles
# a light, gh-style convention — write plain text in the comment, get structure for
# free:
#   line 1                     "<name> — <tagline>"     → name bold

# Why the whole subtree and not just direct children (this was an intermittent

#   • Claude can be the pane LEADER (e.g. `exec claude`): then pgrep -P pane_pid
#     returns only Claude's OWN children (python/caffeinate tool procs), none of
#     which read as claude — so the old direct-children-only scan missed it.
#   • Claude can be a GRANDCHILD (resumed / nested-shell launches), one level
#     below the direct child the old scan stopped at.
# The `node` hedge (Claude launched as `node`) is kept only for a DIRECT child of
# the pane shell — a node straight off a dev pane is claude-as-node; a node buried
# deeper is more likely an MCP server or dev tool, so we match only the

#     fully exited, so $sid has exactly one owner.
#   • ATTACH<TAB>session — the conversation was already backgrounded; just attach.

#   command...   command to run there; omit to open an interactive shell
#
# Runs <command> on <host> over ssh in a login+interactive shell with a TTY, so
# your dotfiles functions (dev, tread, …), Homebrew PATH, and tmux all resolve
# remotely — e.g. `on mini dev dot` starts a dev session there. Each $REMOTE_HOSTS
# alias also gets its own shorthand function (`mini dev dot` ≡ `on mini dev dot`).
# Set aliases in ~/.zshrc.local (REMOTE_HOSTS[mini]=…); an unknown host is used
# as a literal ssh target, so `on box.local uptime` works without registering it.
