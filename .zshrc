# at exec — argv/title rewrites don't touch it), which is the reliable signal.
#
# Why the whole subtree and not just direct children (this was an intermittent
# false-negative — a live, detached Claude rendering with a blank ✓):
#   • Claude can be the pane LEADER (e.g. `exec claude`): then pgrep -P pane_pid
#     returns only Claude's OWN children (python/caffeinate tool procs), none of
#     which read as claude — so the old direct-children-only scan missed it.
#   • Claude can be a GRANDCHILD (resumed / nested-shell launches), one level
#     below the direct child the old scan stopped at.
# The `node` hedge (Claude launched as `node`) is kept only for a DIRECT child of
# the pane shell — a node straight off a dev pane is claude-as-node; a node buried
# deeper is more likely an MCP server or dev tool, so we match only the

# tbeam [-f|--fg] [-d|--detach] [-p|--pick] [-a|--all] [--here] [host] — teleport a
# Claude session between this machine and another (default: $TBEAM_HOST).
# Like tpush, but across machines. Two directions:
#   • PUSH (default): send a session FROM here TO <host>, land it there.
#       – From INSIDE Claude: grabs THIS conversation + $PWD (always detaches — a
#         Bash subprocess has no TTY to ssh -t into; you get an attach hint).
#       – From a plain shell: fzf-pick a session (scoped to $PWD; -a for every repo).
#       Default landing is a detached dev-<repo>-<slot> on <host>; then it ssh's
#       you straight in.
#   • PULL (--here): the reverse — SUMMON a session that lives ON <host> down to
#       here and land it locally. Always fzf-picks (over the host's sessions,
#       scoped to $PWD; -a for every repo), then resumes it in a local dev slot.
# Flags:
#   -f/--fg      resume in the foreground instead of tmux (dies if the shell drops)
#   -d/--detach  (push) leave it running on <host>, just print how to attach
#   -p/--pick    (push) force the picker even when a current session is detectable
#   -a/--all     picker across every project (both directions)
#   --here       PULL from <host> to this machine instead of pushing away
# The session's repo must exist at the same path on both machines (yours all live
# in ~/code everywhere); the transcript is rsync'd across before it resumes.
