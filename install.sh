# Claude Code settings — ~/.claude/settings.json is a REAL COPY seeded from

# needs), the same pattern as ~/.zshrc.local. It is deliberately per-machine and
# untracked: Claude Code WRITES to this file at runtime (/model saves the default
# model, "always allow" appends permission rules, plugin toggles land here), so a
# tracked or symlinked copy keeps the repo dirty and risks committing private
# allow-rules. A legacy author-mode symlink into the repo (the old install
# choice 2) is materialized into a real copy of its current content. Never
# clobber an existing real file.
