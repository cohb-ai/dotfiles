# --- Worktree-separation model (read the "symlink model" note in CLAUDE.md) ---
# The LIVE surface (what $HOME symlinks point at) is a dedicated git worktree pinned
# to `main`, NOT the clone you develop in. install.sh sets that worktree up and points
# the symlinks at it; `dots` keeps it fast-forwarded. The clone at $DOTFILES_DIR stays
# on the dev branch for in-progress work — and because `main` is checked out in the
# worktree, git physically REFUSES to check it out in the dev clone, so a stray
# `git checkout main` / old-style `dots` can never swap the live files out from under
# in-progress work. Override the worktree location with $DOTFILES_MAIN_WT.
#
# Two link modes:
#   default              LINK_SRC = the main worktree   (live = released `main`)
#   DOTFILES_LINK_DEV=1  LINK_SRC = $DOTFILES_DIR        (live = your current dev branch;
#                        the fast inner-loop, set by `dots --dev`)
